Open Stories README
----
_Showing a successful Open research career is possible._

Welcome
---
Welcome! Thank you for visiting the Open Stories project repository. This document (README) gives you introductory information about the project. This project adheres to the [Mozilla Community Participation Guidelines](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/governance/policies/participation/). You're currently in the website repo for the project, which is an ideal place to contribute if you have technical skills.

The Problem
---
Researchers see sharing their research openly as a risk. Many researchers are concerned the won’t get academic promotions, or their research will be scooped if they share it publicly.

Our Solution
---
OpenStories aims to gather success stories of Open advocates and practitioners to show that a successful Open career is possible. OpenStories will re-frame the conversation from risk to communicating that an open successful career is possible. The website will allow open success stories to be searchable by language, location, and research field so researchers can find another researcher’s story they identify with.

Roadmap
---
Mozsprint, May 2018: We'll be focused on starting the website prototype and drafting the recording guide.

Summer 2018: 
Complete a website prototype for OpenStories, and the how-to guide for recording stories.

Fall 2018:
Host OpenStories recording events at conferences and Open Access Week events.

What do we need?
---
You! In whatever way you can help.

**Development**
We need expertise in web development, user experience design, and recordings of researchers sharing how Open has successfully impacted their career. Our next priority is to design a prototype website that will allow users to discover stories by location, language, academic discipline, and researcher type.

If you are wanting to contribute to the website, the [website repo](https://github.com/OpenStories/website) is where you should be! Check out the exisiting issues that need help.

**Communications**
We currently are drafting a how-to guide for librarians and researchers on recording stories. Join us in expanding the guide and consider hosting a recording event in the fall!

If you are wanting to contribute to communications, the [docs repo](https://github.com/OpenStories/docs/blob/master/README.md) is where you should be! Check out the exisiting issues that need help.

**Stories**
Most of all, we need your open success stories. However, we are wanting to not record new stories for the project until late summer 2018 after the how-to guide receives community feedback and revisions. We will begin requesting stories in the fall. If you would like to be notified when we are ready to begin receiving recordings, please sign up [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdqcbZvrYV-uEq0fvW8eBcDwgmd8DHXoGNGA6XG5AhT_MiaYg/viewform?usp=sf_link).

We'd love your feedback along the way, and of course, we'd love to include your story in the future.
