Open Stories README
----
_Showing a successful Open research career is possible._

Welcome
---
Welcome! Thank you for visiting the Open Stories project repository.This document (README) gives you introductory information about the project. 

The Problem
---
Researchers see sharing their research openly as a risk. Many researchers are concerned the won’t get academic promotions, or their research will be scooped if they share it publicly.

Our Solution
---
Open Stories aims to gather success stories of Open advocates and practitioners to show that a successful Open career is possible. Open Stories will re-frame the conversation from risk to communicating that an open successful career is possible. The website will allow open success stories to be searchable by language, location, and research field so researchers can find another researcher’s story they identify with.

Roadmap
---
Mozsprint, May 2018: We'll be focused on starting the website prototype and getting feedback on the recording guide.

Summer 2018: 
Complete a website prototype for Open Stories, and the how-to guide for recording stories 

Fall 2018:
Host Open Stories events at conferences

What do we need?
---
You! In whatever way you can help.

We need expertise in web development, user experience design, and recordings of researchers sharing how Open has successfully impacted their career. We currently are drafting a how-to guide for librarians and researchers on recording stories. Our next priority is to design a prototype website that will allow users to discover stories by location, language, academic discipline, and researcher type. However, we are wanting to not record new stories for the project until summer 2018 after the how-to guide receives community feedback and revisions. 

We'd love your feedback along the way, and of course, we'd love to include your story in the future.

Feedback
---
